I've wanted to start a blog for a long time but never enough to deal with writing a full website for it. When I found you can use Jekyll with Github pages that made it just too easy. So here I go. I'm in the middle of my 100 Days of Code. I started the day before the new year because I didn't want it to be a New Years resolution.

I've been working on learning Go nonstop. I'm really enjoying the language and how much you don't have to lean on external libraries. It's refreshing coming from Java where if you need to do anything in an enterprise way you're adding about 50 dependencies to your application. Redis has been every bit of the blast that I expected it to be. It just makes certain things so much easier.

Anyway I'll keep the first post short and sweet. When I'm not just excited to get a blog up and have meaningful topics to write about I will be putting them here.
